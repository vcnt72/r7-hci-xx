                    Grace, named for the incomparable actress Grace Kelly, always broke expectations, even when it meant
                    she stuck out somehow. She scavenged or bought spare components to build her own computers. She
                    played soccer with the neighborhood boys and got into fights with them, but it was her sharp tongue
                    that landed her in trouble with her teachers. She looked and acted like a troublemaker, so they
                    tried to force her to conform to expectations. To survive, Grace learned to soften her image, to
                    better play with and manipulate preconceptions; she bought fake glasses and adopted the geek girl
                    persona.

                    Meijer's mother was lead engineer on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument that landed on
                    Titan. Encouraged to reach for the stars from an early age, she earned her Bachelor's in Aerospace
                    Engineering at the Koninklijke Militaire Academie. Meijer later applied to become a fighter pilot in
                    the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Unfortunately, her albinism meant that she had compromised retina
                    and her application was refused. She changed her focus to systems engineering and earned her Masters
                    in Embedded Systems at the Delft University of Technology.

                    Weiss's mother is a renowned mathematician and her father is an inventor who high academic standards
                    encouraged Weiss and her siblings to win numerous awards in math, science, and music throughout
                    their school years. Thriving in the gifted program enabled Weiss to complete her first internship
                    with a local tech company at the age of sixteen. She was invited to MIT, where she focused on
                    electrical engineering, achieving accolades for her research in Microelectronics. Weiss then joined
                    Caltech for graduate studies in experimental electrical engineering.
