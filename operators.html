          Military Valor, Martello qualified for Gruppo di Intervento Special (Special Intervention Group or GIS) and
          participated in jointed operations in Iraq, earning a facial scar from a roadside IED. He engaged in multiple

          A North Korean by birth, Chul Kyung Hwa doesn't remember much of his early life. As a child, he and his family
          defected from the oppressive country and made their way across Asia in an attempt to eventually reach the
          Republic of Korea. Throughout it all, everyone impressed upon Chul Kyung that anything he said or any strange
          behavior would get them caught... it was life or death. So he buried his emotions deep, lest he betray his
          parents and be responsible for their capture; he became a stone to the outside world. During the journey, his
          older brother drowned while they were crossing a river. They then stayed in a safe house for over a month in
          near silence before taking a train ride that resulted in soldiers arresting two fellow defectors. His mother
          later grew sick and was slowing them down during a jungle crossing. After they were forced to leave his mother
          behind, Chul's father urged him not to cry so as to not alert nearby armed patrols. Gaining asylum in South

          father, who committed suicide, leaving his son an orphan. Chul Kyung remained a stone, never showing emotion,

          perfecting her assessment of multiple factors a once while carrying precise, controlled, and 
          fluid motions. Imagawa traveled the world to perfect her skills and technique. She later attended
